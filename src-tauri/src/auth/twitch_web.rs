//! Twitch *web* (cookie-based) auth.
//!
//! `gql.twitch.tv` rejects Helix bearer tokens for several internal-ish
//! queries we need (e.g. `subscriptionBenefit` for the sub-anniversary
//! banner). The same queries accept the `auth-token` cookie that
//! twitch.tv sets at login. We capture it via an in-app WebView popup
//! at the login page (modelled on `auth::chaturbate::login_via_webview`),
//! validate via a cheap GQL `CurrentUser` query, and stash the cookie
//! in the keyring under `twitch_browser_auth_token`.
//!
//! This module is independent of `auth::twitch` (the OAuth/Helix flow):
//! they may target different accounts. Mismatch detection compares the
//! web-login to the OAuth-login at capture time and refuses to store
//! when they don't match (the user is asked to log out one before
//! continuing).
